# intrinsic_proper_motion

This is a Python package designed to calculate the intrinsic proper motion of a star within the Galaxy, relative to its surrounding medium. This is achieved by subtracting the Galactic rotation component from the observed proper motion. 

This tool was developed for investigating stellar bow shocks. If you find this tool beneficial for your research, please consider citing our work:
